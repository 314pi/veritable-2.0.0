Using path variables
====================

This document describes how to use the builtin path variables for paths which
can be customized using IMC. Path variables are helpful if you do not want
to hardcode paths e.g. for configuration files but make them relative to a
certain environment, e.g. the user's home/profile.

The following path variables are known to iSCHOOL and replaced automatically:

* $HOME, %HOME%, $PROFILE, %PROFILE%
  - the home/profile directory of the user which started the application
    (e.g. iSCHOOL Master Application)

* $APPDATA, %APPDATA
  - Linux: $HOME/.ischool
  - Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\iSCHOOL
  - Windows Vista/7: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\iSCHOOL

* $GLOBALAPPDATA, %GLOBALAPPDATA%
  - Linux: /etc/ischool
  - Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\iSCHOOL
  - Windows Vista/7: C:\ProgramData\iSCHOOL

* $TEMP, %TEMP%, $TMP, %TMP%:
  - Linux: /tmp
  - Windows: current %TEMP% environment variable:
    - Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Temp
    - Windows Vista/7: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp
